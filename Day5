#use filter function to filter out the elements from list that are divisible by 3 and 5
li=[15,67,87,33,23,90,13,34,89,99,13,6,5]

print(list(filter(lambda n:n%3==0,li)),"divisible by 3")
print(list(filter(lambda n:n%5 ==0,li)),"divisible by 5")

[15, 87, 33, 90, 99, 6] divisible by 3
[15, 90, 5] divisible by 5
